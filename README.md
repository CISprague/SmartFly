# SmartFly
This is an app currently in development, that uses a novel algorithm to exploit the shortfalls of the travel industry's demand influenced prices.

## For example
Say you live in the New York city area and you want to go on holiday in Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands. A roundtrip flight from NYC to Tenerife will easily cost you over $1,500. Instead, you could book a roundtrip flight to Reyjavik, and then within that roundtrip book a roundtrip flight to Tenerife from Reyjavik. You could also fly from NYC to the cheapest way into Europe (Ireland, Amsterdam, Copenhagen), then fly from Europe to Tenerife using one of the budget airlines (EasyJet, RyanAir, etc.).
